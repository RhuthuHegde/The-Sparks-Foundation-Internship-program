Predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
 Predicting the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
